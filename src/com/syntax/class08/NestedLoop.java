		/*
		 * **For you to do:**

Create a program that prompt user with question:  "Do you need a loan?"

If the result is true then prompt user with question: "What is your credit score?". Otherwise eligibility is "Unknown"

Based on the score define users eligibility:

- if score is below  600 --> eligibility = "Not eligible"
- if score is between 600 and 700 inclusive -->  eligibility = "Maybe eligible"
- if score is between 701 and 800 inclusive -->  eligibility = "Eligible"
- if score is higher than any other previous values --> eligibility = "Definitely eligible" .   

**Output:** 

```
The eligibility is ____
```
